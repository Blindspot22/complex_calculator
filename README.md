# complex_calculator
A Rust-based command-line calculator designed for performing basic arithmetic operations with robust error handling. This project demonstrates Rustâ€™s modular capabilities and is structured to be easily extendable for more complex mathematical computations, including advanced parsing, trigonometric functions, and support for complex numbers.
